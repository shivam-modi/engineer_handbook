# 🧭 Principal Engineer Handbook

*A complete A–K guide for Senior / Staff / Principal Backend Engineering*

This repository is a **living handbook** for backend engineers aiming to grow from **SDE-2 → Senior → Staff → Principal** level.

It focuses on **first-principles engineering**, real-world trade-offs, and production-grade systems—not just interview prep.

## 📘 What This Handbook Covers

* Deep **Java & Kotlin internals**
* **Spring Boot** core concepts and internal mechanics
* **Distributed systems** (microservices, Kafka, Sagas, consistency)
* **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Cassandra (internals + optimization)
* **DevOps, Cloud & Kubernetes**
* **Observability & SRE fundamentals**
* **Security engineering** (auth, crypto, threat models)
* **Performance engineering**
* **Architecture reasoning & system design**
* **Design & code quality patterns**
